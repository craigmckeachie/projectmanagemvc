when add new project then save
won't save and render again because it needs id to render
render is called by collection add event which happens on collection.create() 
but the internal implementation adds to collection before save so at the time add event calls addOneProject and render happens the model hasn't called save and doesn't have an id

answer:
instead of listening for add event fire own event added after you know the model has been saved and an id is available
